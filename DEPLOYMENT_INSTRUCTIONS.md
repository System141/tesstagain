# üöÄ Complete Deployment Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites Setup

Your system shows Node.js version compatibility warnings because npm is detecting an older Node.js version in some contexts. The application has been built and tested successfully, so this won't affect the deployment.

### 1. Fix Environment Configuration

**Update your `.env` file with real values:**

```bash
# Copy example and edit with your values
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required environment variables in `.env`:**
```bash
# Get Sepolia RPC URL from Infura, Alchemy, or similar
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Your wallet private key (for deployment only)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here

# Etherscan API key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
```

### 2. Deploy Marketplace Contract

```bash
# Deploy the marketplace contract to Sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-marketplace.js --network sepolia

# Save the contract address that gets printed
```

### 3. Configure Frontend

**Add to `frontend/.env.local`:**
```bash
# Add the deployed marketplace contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS=0xYourMarketplaceContractAddress

# Your existing Pinata credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key
```

## üê≥ VPS Deployment Options

### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or manually:
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Option B: Manual VPS Deployment

```bash
# On your VPS, install Node.js 18+ and Docker
curl -fsSL https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.17.0/node-v20.17.0-linux-x64.tar.xz | tar -xJ
export PATH=$PWD/node-v20.17.0-linux-x64/bin:$PATH

# Clone and deploy
git clone <your-repo>
cd <project-directory>
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these features work:

### Frontend Features:
- [ ] **Connect Wallet**: MetaMask connection works
- [ ] **User Profile**: "My Profile" button appears and shows owned NFTs
- [ ] **Collection Creation**: Create new NFT collections
- [ ] **Marketplace**: Browse collections and view marketplace
- [ ] **Real-time Data**: Collection stats update dynamically

### Marketplace Features (After Contract Deployment):
- [ ] **NFT Listings**: Owners can list NFTs for sale
- [ ] **Buy NFTs**: Users can purchase listed NFTs
- [ ] **Make Offers**: Users can make offers on any NFT
- [ ] **Accept Offers**: Owners can accept offers
- [ ] **Transaction History**: All transactions appear on blockchain

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Warnings
The warnings you see are from npm detecting older Node.js binaries in system paths. Since the build succeeded, these are safe to ignore. For production deployment:

```bash
# Use Node.js 18+ in production
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### Contract Deployment Fails
1. Ensure `.env` has valid `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` (get from Infura/Alchemy)
2. Ensure `PRIVATE_KEY` has Sepolia ETH for deployment
3. Test RPC connection: `curl -X POST $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'`

### Marketplace Not Working
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS` is set in `frontend/.env.local`
2. Ensure marketplace contract is deployed and verified
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
